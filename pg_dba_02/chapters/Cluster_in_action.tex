\chapter{The cluster in action}
PostgreSQL delivers his services ensuring the ACID rules are enforced at any time. This chapter will give 
an outlook of a ``day in the life'' of a PostgreSQL's cluster. The chapter approach is purposely generic. 
At this stage is very important to understand the global picture rather the technical details. 

\section{After the startup}
When the cluster completes the startup procedure it starts accepting the connections. When a connection  
is successful then the postgres main process forks into a new backend process which is assigned to the 
client for the connection's lifetime. The fork is quite expensive and does not work very well for a 
high rate of connection's requests. The maximum number of connections is set at startup and cannot be 
changed dynamically. Whether the connection is used or not for each connection slot are consumed ~400 bytes 
of shared memory.\newline

Alongside the client's request the cluster have several processes working in the background. 

\section{The write ahead log}\index{write ahead log} 
The data pages are stored into the shared buffer either for read and write. A mechanism called pinning 
ensures that only one backend at time is accessing the requested page. If the backend modifies the page then 
this becomes dirty\index{page, dirty}. A dirty page is not yet written on its data file. However the page's 
change is first saved on the write ahead log as WAL record and the commit status for the transactions is 
stored in the directory clog or pg\_serial, depending on the transaction isolation level. The wal buffers 
ready for the flush are stored into a shared buffer's area sized by the parameter wal\_buffers.  
Inside the pg\_xlog directory there are the actual WAL files organised in fixed size segments. When a 
WAL segment is full then a a new one is created or recycled. When this happens there is a xlog switch. The 
dedicated background process WAL writer\index{WAL writer} manages the writes to the WAL. This process 
is present from PostgreSQL 8.3.

\section{The checkpoint}
The cluster, on a regular basis, executes an important activity called checkpoint. The frequency 
of this action is governed by the time and space, measured respectively in seconds and log switches between 
two checkpoints. The checkpoint scans the shared buffer and writes down to the data files all the dirty 
buffers. When the checkpoint is complete the process determines the checkpoint location and writes this 
information on the control file stored into the cluster's pg\_global tablespace. In the case of an unclean 
shutdown this value is used to determine the WAL segment from where to start the crash recovery. \newline

Before the version 8.3 the checkpoint represented a potential bottleneck because the unavoidable IO spike 
generated during the writes. That's the reason why it was introduced the concept of spread checkpoint. The 
cluster aims to a particular completion target time measured in percentage of the checkpoint timeout. The 
default values are respectively 0.5 and 5 minutes which corresponds to a target time of 2.5 minutes. From 
PostgreSQL 9.2 a dedicated checkpointer process manages the checkpoint activity.


\section{The background writer}
Before the spread checkpoints the only solution to reduce the IO spike caused by the checkpoint was to 
tweak the background writer. This was one of the new features of the revolutionary PostgreSQL 8.0. The 
writer, as the name suggests, works in the background searching for the dirty buffers to write on the data 
files. The writer works in rounds. When the process awakes scans the shared buffer and stops when has 
cleaned the amount of buffers set in bgwriter\_lru\_maxpages. The process then sleeps for the time set in 
bgwriter\_delay. 

\section{The autovacuum}
The routine vacuuming is an important task to prevent the table bloat and the dreaded XID wraparound 
failure. If enabled the autovacuum launcher take care of this taks automatically. The launcer starts one 
daemon for each relation with enough dead tuples to trigger the conditions set in 
autovacuum\_vacuum\_threshold and autovacuum\_vacuum\_scale\_factor. An autovacuum daemon is a normal 
backend and appears in the view pg\_stat\_activity. Because the XID wraparound failure is a serious issue, 
the autovacuum to prevent wraparound starts even if the autovacuum is turned off.

\section{The backends}
\label{sec:CLUBACKEND}
The PostgreSQL backend architecture is the brilliant solution for ensuring the concurrent access to the 
buffers and avoid the bottleneck of a long waiting queue. When a backend needs to access a particular tuple, 
either for read or write, the relation's pages are accessed to find the tuple matching the search criteria. 
When a buffer is accessed then the backend sets a pin onto it preventing the other backends to access the 
same page. As soon as the tuple is found and processed the pin is removed and the next backend in the queue 
will get the pin. If the tuple is modified the MVCC guarantee the other backends will see the correct 
tuple's version. The process is fine grained and very efficient. Even with an high concurrency rate on the 
same buffers is very difficult to have the backends entangled.\newline

A backend process is a fork of the main postgres process. It's very important to understand that the 
backend is not the connection but a server process assigned to the connection. Usually the backend 
terminates when the connection disconnects. However, if a client disconnects ungracefully meanwhile a query 
is running and does not signal the backend, the query will continue to run and eventually will find 
that the client is disappeared.  This is bad for many reasons. First because is consuming 
a connection slot for nothing. Also the cluster is doing something useless consuming CPU cycles and memory. 
\newline

Like everything in PostgreSQL the backend architecture is oriented to protect the data and in particular 
the volatile shared buffer. If for some reasons one of the backend process crashes then the postgres 
process terminates all the backends in order to prevent the potential shared buffer corruption. The clients 
should be able to manage this exception resetting the connection when required.\newline

\section{Wrap up}
The cluster's background activity remains most of the time unnoticed. The users and the developers can 
ignore this aspect of the PostgreSQL architecture leaving the difficult taks of understanding the 
database's heartbeat to the DBA, which should have the final word on any potential mistake in the design 
specs. The next chapters will explore the PostgreSQL's architecture in details.
