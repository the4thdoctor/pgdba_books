\chapter*{Preface}
When I first came up with the idea to write a PostgreSQL DBA book, my intention was to 
publish it commercially.\newline

Shortly I changed my mind as I became aware the uniqueness of a book for the database 
administrators. Then I decided to keep this book free. The same will happen for the 
next books in this series. I hope this will spread the knowledge on PostgreSQL becoming an 
useful reference.\newline

Just a quick advice before you start reading. I beg your pardon in advance for my 
bad English. Unfortunately I'm not native English and it's very likely the book to be full of 
typos and bad grammar.\newline

However, if you want to help me in cleaning and reviewing the text please fork 
the github repository where I have shared the latex sources 
\href{https://github.com/the4thdoctor/pgdba\_books}{

\section*{Intended audience}
Database administrators, System administrators, Developers

\section*{Book structure}
This book assumes the reader knows how to perform basic user operations such as
connecting to the database and creating tables.\newline

The book covers the basic aspects of database administration from installation
to cluster management.\newline

A couple of chapters are dedicated to the logical and physical structure in
order to show two sides of the same coin.  The triplet of maintenance, backup and restore completes the 
the picture. This is not exhaustive but is good enough to start getting ``hands on'' with the database.
The final chapter is dedicated to the developers. The various sections 
give advice that can seem quite obvious. It's better to repeat things instead of making dangerous
mistakes when building an application. 

\chapter*{Version and platform}
This book is based on PostgreSQL version 9.3 running on Debian GNU Linux 7.
References to older versions or different platforms are explicitly specified.

\chapter*{Thanks}
